                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Baja SAE is an Collegiate Design Series competition run by the Society of Automotive Engineers
                    International (SAE International). Teams of students from universities all over the world design
                    and build small off-road cars. The cars all have engines of the same specifications. As of 2018
                    the engine has been an unmodified Briggs & Stratton Model 19 Vanguard engine single-cylinder
                    with a displacement of 305cc and power output of approximately 10 bhp (7.5 kW). <br><br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe goal in Baja SAE racing is to design, build and race off-road 
                    vehicles that can withstand the harshest elements of rough terrain. The vehicles used in Baja
                    SAE racing are often similar in appearance to dune buggies. Before 2007, the events were 
                    called "Mini Baja."

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt's a Snakes game where you play vs the computer.
                    The objective of the game is to make the other player crash.
                    This project is aimed at developing a Multiplayer Snakes and Ladders Game,
                    which can be played over LAN. This game has been built using Java which is platform independent
                    and applet based hence lightweight.
                    The snake game is simple game.In this game the snake is eating some foods and get its size 
                    larger in step by step and getting some score.
                    This is small game .In this if the player has to change the direction of the snake for 
                    getting food for snake.<br><br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSnakes and ladders, or chutes and ladders, is a classic children's board game.
                    It is played between 2 or more players on a playing board with numbered grid squares.
                    On certain squares on the grid are drawn a number of "ladders" connecting two squares together,
                    and a number of "snakes" or "chutes" also connecting squares together.
                    The size of the grid (most commonly 8×8, 10×10 or 12×12) varies from board to board, 
                    as does the exact arrangement of the chutes and the ladders: both of these may affect the duration of game play.
                    The main thing behind by doing this project was playing the snakes and ladders game online .
